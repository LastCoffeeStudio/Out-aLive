Installing Unity Integration
----------------------------

The easiest way to install the Unity integration is from the Fbx Export Settings in Unity.

        MenuBar -> Edit -> Project Settings -> Fbx Export -> Install Unity Integration

It will use the 3D application specified in the "3D Application" dropdown located above the
button. The dropdown will show all supported Maya, Maya LT and 3ds Max versions located in the default installation location.
To handle non-default installation locations, either select the browse option in the dropdown
and browse to the desired executable location, or set the MAYA_LOCATION environment variable.
